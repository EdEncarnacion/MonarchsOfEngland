This project is intended for research and educational purposes.

The code was executed using the following libraries:
    pandas ~ 1.4.3
    matplotlib ~ 0.1.6

NOTES:
- The study of history is always a complex matter, there are things that must be simplified to understand the historical framework in a broader concept.
- For this reason, the used dataset is a simplified summary of the different Kings and Queens that ruled England, however the analysis, which I initially thought would be too simple, grew, in my opinion, almost organically.
- Due to the above, I decided to make two Jupyter notebooks, the first (PartI) is focused on analyzing the original dataset, and the second (PartII) includes new information obtained by my own research and uses Seaborn as the basis for visualizations.
- I recommend reviewing these notebooks in the assigned order to understand how I manipulated the information and get it to show what I wanted to show the way I wanted to show it.
- Finally, as mentioned above, I would like to emphasize that although the history of the Kings and Queens of England is more complex than these datasets, the ultimate purpose of this analysis is to show the line of thought to extract, manipulate and present insights based on data and not on the veracity of the data itself.

Finally, as for the series to create each Royal House I selected each King´s/Queen´s page and look for the House they belong to. You can start with the first King: Egbert
